👋 Hi there, I'm Robert!

🚀 About Me

I'm an enthusiastic Electronics and FPGA developer with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Electronics-ICT, combining theoretical learning with practical applications to build the future of technology.

👀 My Interests

Electronics: Designing and understanding circuits is my bread and butter.
FPGA Development: I love diving into hardware description languages and exploring the potential of reconfigurable computing.
Cycling: When I'm not working with electronics, you’ll probably find me enjoying a long bike ride, exploring the outdoors.

🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm sharpening my skills in areas like:

Digital logic design and embedded systems
Programming languages (Python, C, VHDL, etc.)
Building efficient, robust, and scalable solutions

🤝 Collaboration

I'm eager to collaborate on projects related to:

Open-source electronics tools and libraries
FPGA-based designs and implementations
Exciting IoT or embedded system applications
If you have a project in mind or just want to brainstorm, don’t hesitate to reach out!
